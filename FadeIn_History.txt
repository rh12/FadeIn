    2014.04.04.     FadeIn v1.2.2.2
    ========================================================
    : redesigned the animation system
        - movement and zoom are animated simultaneously
        - moving to target location is independent of ScrollBounds (and Zoom)
    : added drawable debug lines (midLines, scrollBounds, etc.)
    - fixed some master-to-channel zoom related bugs
    + added support for LogicModules
        - an LM is like a Channel, but inside a MasterSection,
        - LMs are allowed to have various sizes, and are not always vertical
        - in XML: <moduleDef logic="1"...>
        - LMs have a Scroll Direction
            - (V) Vertical (default), (H) Horizontal, (A) AllDir
            - in XML: <moduleDef scrollDir="H"...>
        - when an LM is activated:
            - InfoBar shows the name of the Active LM (and M in the QuickJump Button)
            - other LMs (and anything else) are greyed out
        - if there is no Active LM:
            - InfoBar shows no name (but shows the M)
            - all LMs (and anything else) are grayed out
    + added MasterCloseup viewmode
        - Tap on a LogicModule inside Master to zoom-in on it (or use Zoom)
        - Tap QuickJump button to zoom-out to MasterSection viewmode (or use Zoom)
        - when enabled:
            - free Scroll in all directions (scroll bounds set to MasterModule bounds)
                - Scroll can be restricted to one direction (to help staying in the active LogicModule)
                - this restriction depends on the Active LogicModule (when the Scroll begun)
                    - there is no Active LogicModule --> free Scroll
                    - there is an Active LogicModule, and its ScrollDir matches
                        and the starting direction of the Scroll --> restrict Scroll to ScrollDir
            - ActiveLogicModule changes when a LogicModule reaches the center of the view
                - InfoBar shows the name of ActiveLogicModule
                - InforBar shows nothing if there is no LogicModule at center
            - Tapping on a LogicModule activates it (centers on it)
                - when Tapping outside any LogicModules it just moves there
        - remembered on Exit
    - changed the dummy MasterSection of A&H GL2400 to a more complicated one
        - DELETE previous GL2400 Sessions & Favorites !!

            - Lock button is locked and disabled
            - all modules look like ActiveModules (no darkening & desaturation)
            - Scrollbar is hidden
            - ActiveModule changes when a MainModule reaches the center of the view
                - InfoBar updates normally when ActiveModule changes
                - InforBar shows nothing if there is no MainModule at center
            - free Scroll in all directions (console bounds still apply)
            - Tapping on a different Module activates it (centers on it, but still in FreeVM)
            - extra ZoomStop (4ch wide) (even that lags on some consoles)
        - can be disabled by the appeared (F) button or from the Toolbar
        - when disabled:
            - sets Channel or MasterSection viewmode (depending on ActiveModule)
                - never sets MasterCloseup viewmode
            - removes the extra ZoomStop, Zooms to closest one
            - moves to horizontal center of ActiveModule
                - if there is no ActiveModule: activates the closest MainModule
            - removes the (F) button, enables the Lock button (but stays in Lock)

        - changing from Channel to Master, and Master to Channel is implemented
            - when changing to Master, scene zooms out to fit width, hiding the Scrollbar
            - saves parameters for Channels: zoom, y-position, channel name editing
            - when Tapping to Master, temporarily saves inside/outside Tap Tresholds
                for quickly skipping through the Master (disabled after 0.7 sec)
        - included in QuickJump view
        - Name is not editable
