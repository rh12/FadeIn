            FadeIn uses a simple hierarchy to help you organize your gigs. Let's look at a festival (an Event), which have several days (Sessions), and each day you want to store your work after each soundcheck (Scene).<br>
            <br>
            In this scenario you add a <b>new Event</b> by pressing the '+' button in the Sessions tab and select <i>Event</i>. After customizing various details you create the Event by pressing <i>Done</i>. You can change these details any time by pressing <i>Edit</i>.<br>
            <br>
            On the Event page you can <b>add Sessions</b> one by one. When creating a Session (and any time after that) you can add Equipment to it. Each new Session will have the Equipment of the previous Session preselected for you, and the date is incremented by one day.<br>
            <br>
            On a Session page you can <b>add Scenes</b> for each band. You can assign an Artist to a Scene and select Equipment to use from the Session (or add new ones).<br>
            Selecting a Scene loads its default Equipment to the <a href="help_scview.html">Soundcheck view</a>. If the Equipment has not yet been loaded in this Session, the app loads the <b>Setup Defaults</b> page, where you can customize the default values for each module type.<br>
            <br>
            If you want to <b>view the Scene page</b> instead of loading the Soundcheck view, press the corresponding blue arrow.<br>
            <br>
            You can create a <b>Single Session Event</b> if your Event does not span multiple days, or you are interested in only one act. To do this press the '+' button in the Sessions tab, but select <i>Session</i> instead of <i>Event</i>.<br>
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="pTitle">Artists</div>
            You can create a <b>new Artist</b> by pressing the '+' button either in the Artists tab or when assigning an Artist to a Scene.<br>
            <br>
            Pressing the <i>Scenes</i> button on an Artist page presents you the list of <b>related Scenes</b>.<br>
            <br>
            Pressing the <i>Info</i> button on a Scene page brings you to the <b>related Artist page</b>.<br>
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="pTitle">Venues</div>
            You can create a <b>new Venue</b> by pressing the '+' button either in the Venues tab or when setting a Venue for an Event or Session.<br>
            <br>
            Pressing the <i>Events &amp; Sessions</i> button on a Venue page presents you the list of <b>related Events and Sessions</b>.<br>
            <br>
            Pressing the <i>Info</i> button on an Event or Session page brings you to the <b>related Venue page</b>.<br>
        </div>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
            <div class="pTitle">Tips</div>
            To delete an Event (or any other item), select it from the list, press <i>Edit</i> at the top of its page, then press the <i>Delete</i> button which appears at the bottom.<br>
            <br>
            Your Events and Sessions are ordered by date, but you can reorder your Scenes freely in a given Session by draging them around in Edit mode.<br>
            <br>
            If you use multiple Equipment in a Scene, the first one is loaded by default. On the Scene page you can load any of the Equipment listed, and you can reorder them in Edit mode.<br>
            <br>
            If you want to add several Sessions to an Event first, and add Scenes later, you should add the Sessions in Edit mode. This way the newly added Sessions will not appear automatically. You can also use this method when adding Scenes to a Session.<br>
            <br>
            The values you set on the Setup Defaults page will be used as default values for all Scenes in that Session. If you don't want to use the Setup Defaults feature, you can disable it in the Settings.<br>
            <br>
            When Editing a Scene you deselect an Equipment, all stored values will be deleted for that Equipment (only in the current Scene, of course). Reselecting it will not bring the values back.<br>
