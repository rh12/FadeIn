    <div class="paragraph">
        <div class="pTitle">Navigation</div>
        You can <b>scroll</b> the Active Module by swiping vertically on the screen, or you can use the Scrollbar. The Scrollbar also highlights your current position in the Active Module.<br>
        <br>
        You can <b>move on</b> to another module by swiping horizontally on the screen, or by tapping outside the Active Module. You can also jump to any Module by tapping the Module button at the top of the screen.<br>
        <br>
        You can <b>Zoom</b> between predefined zoom values. Upon lifting a finger, the screen snaps to the closest zoom value.<br>
        The available zoom values are 3-channel wide, 2-channel wide, and real-size.<br>
        <br>
        When the Soundcheck view is <b>locked</b>, changing module skips unedited modules, so you can quickly reach the modules which are important to you. The QuickJump is not affected by the lock.<br>
        <br>
        The various navigation gestures, the Scrollbar position and the lock-skip behaviour can be costumized in the in-app Settings.<br>
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
        <div class="pTitle">Adjusting Controls</div>
        You can <b>select</b> a control by tapping on it once, and you can <b>adjust</b> it by touching it again and dragging your finger. When selected, the control's name will be displayed in white, and during adjustment the name will turn yellow.<br>
        After a few seconds (or if you tap anywhere else) the control will get deselected, and its name disappears from the top of the screen.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Knobs</b> can be adjusted by moving your finger around them, <b>faders</b> and <b>switches</b> by moving it vertically (or horizontally, in case of horizontal switches).<br>
        <br>
        <b>Buttons</b> also can be switched by dragging vertically, or you can simply tap on a button again after a selection to switch it (in other words: doing a double tap).<br>
        This behaviour can be turned off in the in-app Settings.<br>
        <br>
        Those <b>LEDs</b> which don't have a corresponding button, can be switched just like regular buttons.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Dual concentric knobs</b> work the same way as regular knobs, except you can alternate between the inner and outer parts by tapping on the knob again. You don't need to aim for the specific part, the first tap always selects the inner knob.<br>
        If the knobs should move together (ie.: stereo gains), then the first tap selects both knobs, the second tap the inner, etc.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Knobs with an incorporated button</b> work the same way as regular knobs, except you can tap on the knob again after a selection to switch it. (Just like regular buttons, except it ignores the 'Double Tap Adjusts' setting.)<br>
        The state of the switch is visible on the assigned LED.<br>
        <br>
        To help you determine the state of buttons at a glance, turned on buttons are surrounded with a glow.<br>
        Buttons (and standalone LEDs) display their current state next to their names at the top of the screen. Dual knobs also display which part is selected at the moment.<br>

    <div class="paragraph">
        The bar at the top of the screen displays information regarding the Active Module. It also contains the <a href="help_sc-toolbar.html">Toolbar button</a>, which provides access to various functions.<br>
        <br>
        The <b>Module button</b> displays the active channel number, and shows whether the Active Module has been edited.<br><b>No border</b> means it hasn't been edited yet, <span style="color: #009900"><b>green border</b></span> means it has been edited in this Scene, <span style="color: #DE8021"><b>orange border</b></span> means it has been edited in other Scenes but not in the current one.<br>
        <br>
        You can edit the <b>name</b> of the Active Module by tapping on the current name. You can exit Edit mode by tapping on the Active Module, on any button or pressing Done.<br>
        <br>
        You can add <b>Notes</b> or <b>Photos</b> for the Active Module by pressing the Notes/Photos button. Here you can record additional info for each channel, such as inserts, used mics, etc.<br>(Photos are supported only on devices with camera.)<br>
    </div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">
        <div class="pTitle">Lock</div>
        You can Lock all controls and disable all editing options by pressing the Lock button.<br>
        The app Autolocks whenever you exit the current Soundcheck view, quit the app or have an incoming call.<br>
