<1.4 BUGS:
=============
! Help, images may disappear
    - specific Help page was displayed before (so image had been loaded)
    - after loading FadeIn from background
    - image was cleared from cache behind the back of webview?
! rapidly selecting a button and another may leave InfoBar in invalid state
    - cInfoView is hidden but mInfoView has not shown
    - OR the other way around
    - occures rarely, cant reproduce consistently
        - slow motion does not help
        - calling NSLog-s here and there makes it very rare
! MH2 & MH3 M-ST texture float issue: top & eq
! MH2 & MH3 button colors


_______________
|  1.4 TODO   |  (ignore 1.3 wip features, for now)
===============
! disappearing navBar
    - reach SCVC through Notebook, go back
    - Continue to notebook-reached-SCVC, go back -> noNavBar
! photobrowser full-screen - safe area issue
? all textures should be x2:
- Textures
    - when loading a tex file, there is a @2x version: store it somewhere
        (or store every file dimension in a texSizeArray)
    - in XML <texture ... x0="" also set 2x0=""
    - when loading equipment save the relevant x0 value (x0 or 2x0),
        depending on the stored @2x.png availability
    - w="" and h="" values should simply be doubled for @2x
        NO!! button textures are already big, so check for 2w and 2h, and double if not found
    - thats all that is needed for @2x support
- about page
- iphoneX support

|  1.3 TODO   |
===============

MASTER SECTION:
===============
- updateLayout flickers sometimes when showing/hiding Scrollbar

- Scroll restrict idea:
    - Scroll can be restricted to one direction (to help staying in the active LogicModule)
        - if after the activation of a LogicModule
            - some small time passed without Scrolling
            - a Control on it was selected
            - there was a Zoom gesture
        - or if the LogicModule was activated by
            - Zooming or Tapping on it
            - Continuing a saved Scene


- PM3000
    - Knob small/big foltos
- Favorites:
    - should display before using (or blue arrow it)
    - should be able to edit Favorite CDs later


RETINA DISPLAY:
===============
- UPDATE FACEBOOK IMAGES


_______________
|  1.x TODO   |
===============

- CoreData
    - exception handling (in AppDelegate)

    SCVIEW OPENGL
- OpenGL optimizaton:
    - animation: should use timeframe of displayLink to calculate position???
    - multitexture: binding/enabling/disabling may need revision?
- Labels
- ItemLabels
    - should improve inactive desaturation (add dominantColor attribute in XML?)
? conditional XML (could check for tags in parent module)

    SCVIEW
- Pitch UI
- Motion Detection (iPhone/iPod 4+ only)

    SCVIEW HUD
- Dropdown menu:
    - Change Equipment
    - Pitch
- QuickJump facelift
    - Button images should match InfoBar
    - Highlighted Module text should be nicer
    - Buttons should display Notes (?)
- LoadValues
    - general facelift
    ? should not show current Scene
    ? default Scene should be previous (or Reset, if there is no previous Scene)


PERFORMANCE:
=============
- laggy on scrolling (animation) but not when draging the SB
    - SB update takes time (redraw, not the calculation)
    - propably too much vertex (VBOs?)
- slow QuickJump display
- when Zoomed out, should use smaller models (and maybe textures)


RETINA DISPLAY:
===============
- Textures
    - when loading a tex file, there is a @2x version: store it somewhere
        (or store every file dimension in a texSizeArray)
    - in XML <texture ... x0="" also set 2x0=""
    - when loading equipment save the relevant x0 value (x0 or 2x0),
        depending on the stored @2x.png availability
    - w="" and h="" values should simply be doubled for @2x
        NO!! button textures are already big, so check for 2w and 2h, and double if not found
    - thats all that is needed for @2x support


CLIPBOARD:
==========
? DateInterval validation
? Landscape orientation
? expand Artist Entity: Artist(name, photo, notes, (iPhone contacts)crew/contacts/artists)
- import/export
    ? whole DB
    ? individual Events/Sessions/Scenes/Venues/etc)
    ? for backup
    ? for sharing with friends (email, wifi, etc?)
- copy/move scenes, sessions (maybe move only???)
    - in Edit mode
    - press parent session/event row
    - show action sheet with: copy/move/cancel
    - show modal Events List with cancel/done button in NavBar
        maybe jump to / mark current parent
    - for Sessions:
        select marks/unmarks the row
    - for Scenes:
        Event rows have gray Detail arrow on right, select pushes Sessions List (and unmarks any row)
        Session row select marks/unmarks the row
    ? if parent becomes empty ask to erase it
    - after copy/move rebuild NavigationStack
    ? exit Edit mode


SCVIEW:
=======
    SCVIEW HUD
- display differences from last (?) Scene, Control by Control
    - show on InfoBar.Channel per Module
    - show on Scrollbar per Control
    - show on SCView per Control (???)
- Channel Name editing
    - Landscape orientation
        - TextField rotating accordingly
    - External keyboard
        - will (may?) use Landscape, but wont show Keyboard
        - need to place stuff accordingly

    SCVIEW
? Channel Swipe
    - if finger is stopped (drag): late treshold, if not stopped (swipe): early treshold
? SCView Locked, controls accept touches as if adjusted
? Console Borders

    INSERT
- in place of Notes button:
    - dropdown button
    - for Linked Equipment:
        - maybe only Link back button?
        - how to decide:
            Console or Rack by class
- Link:
    - long press to Edit???

  DUNNO:

DEMO:
=============
- calcDimensionsForModuleDef doesn't count with DemoLimit
- moduleArray doesn't care about DemoLimit
